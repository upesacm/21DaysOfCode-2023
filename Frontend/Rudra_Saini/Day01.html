        Isro chief S Somnath on Wednesday said the Chandrayaan-3 mission to the moon is ready for launch and will lift
        off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota between July 12 to 19. A report by PTI news agency citing
        officials said the launch will take place on July 13, but the Isro chief said the exact date for launch will be
        announced once all the tests are completed."Currently the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft is fully integrated. We have
        completed the testing. Currently, the window of opportunity for launch is between July 12 to 19. We will
        announce the exact date after all the tests are completed," said Somnath.

        The Chandrayaan-3 mission will launch on the Geosynchronous Launch Vehicle Mark-III, India's heaviest rocket to
        the Moon.

        Earlier, Somnath said the period between July 12 to July 19 is optimal for launch when the orbital dynamics will
        ensure minimal fuel and higher efficiency in the journey to the Moon.The Chandrayaan-3 mission will explore the
        far side of the Moon and will attempt to soft land on the lunar surface. The primary objective will be to
        demonstrate soft landing capability on the Moon and make India only the fourth country in the world to have that
        ability.
