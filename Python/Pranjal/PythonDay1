#1. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter their name and then prints a greeting message in the format "Hello, {Your Name}!".

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}")



#2. Write a Python program that takes a sentence as input and prints the reverse of each word in the sentence. 
For example, if the input is "Hello World!", the output should be "olleH dlroW!".

sen = input("Enter a sentence: ")
words = sen.split()
reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]
reversed_sentence = ' '.join(reversed_words)
print(reversed_sentence)
